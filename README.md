# Deep Learning and Computer Vision

This repository contains the results of exercises for the Deep Learning and Computer Vision class in Jean Monnet University, lectured by Professor Damien Muselet. 
The course aims at providing fundamental basics about usage of Deep Learning in Computer Vision.
Students will make use of the theoretical knowledge they have learned in the course “Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Algorithms”, deepen and apply them to many problems in computer vision such as image classification, object recognition, object detection, object tracking, …
